## Description

Sample game project using the Godot engine.
All code and assets in this project are public domain, feel free to use them however you like.

## Changes of this fork
* Ported project to Godot 3.1
* All scenes and animation was redone because Godot failed to export it (I tried to preserve it as close to original as possible)
* Code was slightly refactored to include strong typing
